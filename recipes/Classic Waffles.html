    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p> A waffle is a dish made from leavened batter or dough that is cooked between two plates<br> that are patterned to give 
        a characteristic size, shape, and surface impression. <br>There
         are many variations based on the type of waffle iron and recipe used.
